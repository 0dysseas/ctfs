Encryption- No password prompt provided in debug mode

enc():
  . 1st loop is:0x4490-449a
  . for 256 times (increase r13 by 0x100):
    add one byte to 0x247c
  . move 0x247c to r12. So r12 contains 100 bytes (0-100, in hex)
  
  . 2nd loop: 44a4-44d0 (256 times)
  . move byte by byte of 'ThisIsSecureRight?' to r10 (i.e. each char)
  . add 0x247c to each char of the above string
  . then take the output of the addition and add it to r9
  . then fill r10 and r12 with the contents of r8 and r9 byte by byte

Turns out enc() is a decoy- Upon entering a password we can see that there's a call to a specific memory address the body of which is populated only when the password is entered (due to a copy_data call). After that and using the debugger we can see that there's a cmp instruction which examines if the first two bytes of our code are equal to 3384. If yes, door unlocks. So the password is 0x3384.
